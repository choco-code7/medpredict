    <h1>Heart Dataset Documentation</h1>

    <h2>Overview:</h2>

    <p>The "heart" dataset contains clinical and demographic information about patients, aiming to predict the presence of heart disease. It includes features such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol level, fasting blood sugar level, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy, and thalassemia. The target variable, 'target', indicates the presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease.</p>

    <h2>Potential Use Cases:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Developing predictive models to identify individuals at risk of heart disease based on their clinical and demographic characteristics.</li>
        <li>Exploring the relationship between various risk factors and the likelihood of heart disease.</li>
        <li>Assessing the importance of different features in predicting the presence of heart disease.</li>
    </ol>
